# Calculator-using-avr-Atmega-32-
AVR-based calculator using Atmega32, developed during my internship at AMIT. It performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) with user input via a keypad and output on a 16x2 LCD. This project demonstrates embedded C programming and microcontroller interfacing.
