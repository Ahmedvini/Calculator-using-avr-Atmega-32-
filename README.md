# AVR-Based Calculator (Atmega32)

This project is a simple calculator built using the Atmega32 microcontroller, developed during my internship at **AMIT**. It performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) with a **16x2 LCD display** for output and a **keypad interface** for input. This project demonstrates embedded C programming and microcontroller interfacing.

## Features
- Arithmetic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- LCD display for output
- Keypad for input

## Requirements

### Hardware
- Atmega32 Microcontroller
- 16x2 LCD Display
- Keypad
- Breadboard, jumpers, and power supply

### Software
- **Atmel Studio** for development.
- **USBasp** or **AVR programmer** for flashing.

## Setup

1. Open in Atmel Studio, compile the source code (`CALC.c`), and generate the `.hex` file.

2. Use an AVR programmer to flash the `Calc.hex` to the Atmega32 microcontroller.

3. Connect the LCD and keypad according to the wiring in `LCD_config.h` and `KPD_config.h`.

4. Power the circuit, input numbers and operations via the keypad, and view results on the LCD.
   
## Proteus Simulation

For those using Proteus for simulation, hereâ€™s the circuit connection used for this project. Refer to the image below for detailed wiring of the LCD, keypad, and Atmega32 in Proteus.

## Future Enhancements
- Add complex operations (square root, exponentiation).
- Memory functions for storing results.
- Graphical LCD or OLED display.
